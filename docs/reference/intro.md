# Introduction

This page provides documentation and code examples for utilizing OpenAPI v3.1 and gRPC API Gateway plug-ins.

This project includes two `protoc` plug-ins:

1. **`protoc-gen-grpc-api-gateway`**: This plug-in generates a reverse proxy in Go, leveraging the code generated by the [Go](https://protobuf.dev/reference/go/go-generated/) and [Go gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/quickstart/) plug-ins. The reverse proxy offers an HTTP handler that translates HTTP requests into gRPC.

2. **`protoc-gen-openapiv3`**: This plug-in generates an OpenAPI v3.1 document for the reverse proxy HTTP server. Since OpenAPI v3.1 is designed for RESTful HTTP APIs, this plug-in does not currently support WebSockets, which means some streaming endpoints may be excluded from the generated document.
