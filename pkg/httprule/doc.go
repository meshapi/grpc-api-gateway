// Package httprule contains utilities to describe HTTP route rules and is used by the configs and the code generators
// to prepare HTTP routes.
//
// This is a package mostly useful for gateway mux developers and other internal tools.
// Unless you are building a gRPC gateway serve mux or tooling related to the gateway, do not use these
// packages. These packages are indirectly used when you use the code generator.
